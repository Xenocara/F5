You can use those two scripts for BIG-IP 11.X and 12.X versions. Basically you need to run "parseConf" as first and then if you need to have summarized infos about vs definitions. parseConf just exports vs definitions as files and gives vs's names as file name.
Virtual servers which generated by an iApp, converted as normal virtual servers. The script (parseConf) adds a tag (__APP) on exported file names as a postfix if they generated by an iApp. Also script adds "__DISABLED" tag as a postfix which is disabled by hand.
